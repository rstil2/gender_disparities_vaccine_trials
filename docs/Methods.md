# Methods

## Study Design
This study employs a longitudinal analysis of gender participation rates in clinical trials across three major infectious diseases: COVID-19, Ebola, and HIV. We used a Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach to analyze historical trends and project future participation rates.

## Data Sources
### Historical Data Collection
- COVID-19: Data from 2020-2022 (n=3 trials)
- Ebola: Data from 2014-2020 (n=5 trials)
- HIV: Data from 1994-2020 (n=7 trials)

### Data Processing
- Linear interpolation for missing years
- Validation of data quality and completeness
- Conversion of all measurements to standardized percentages

## Statistical Analysis
### Bayesian Hierarchical Model
We implemented a hierarchical Bayesian model using PyMC with the following components:

1. Global Parameters:
   - μ_β0 (global intercept)
   - σ_β0 (intercept variance)
   - μ_β1 (global slope)
   - σ_β1 (slope variance)

2. Disease-Specific Parameters:
   - β0_offset (disease-specific intercept adjustment)
   - β1_offset (disease-specific slope adjustment)

### Prior Distributions
- μ_β0 ~ Normal(0, 1)
- σ_β0 ~ HalfNormal(1)
- μ_β1 ~ Normal(0, 0.1)
- σ_β1 ~ HalfNormal(0.1)

### Model Fitting
- MCMC sampling using the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS)
- 2,000 posterior samples
- 1,000 tuning steps
- 4 parallel chains
- Target accept rate: 0.9

## Prediction and Uncertainty Analysis
### Future Projections
- Time horizon: 2040
- 95% credible intervals calculated from posterior distributions
- Transformation of logit predictions to percentage scale

### Sensitivity Analysis
- Prior sensitivity checks
- Model assumption validation
- Cross-validation of predictions

## Software and Reproducibility
All analyses were conducted using Python 3.x with the following key packages:
- PyMC for Bayesian modeling
- NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
